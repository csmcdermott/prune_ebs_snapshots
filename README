This is a nagios plugin that prunes Amazon AWS EBS snapshots. You 
provide the Access Key, Secret Access Key, Volume ID, number of 
days of snapshots to keep, and retention period as arguments.

The fourth argument - number of days of snapshots to keep, is 
pretty self-explanatory. Any snapshot created more recently than 
that is kept. The last argument - retention period - must be either
'm' or 'q' (monthly or quarterly). The script will also retain one
snapshot per period - so one per month for monthly, and one per 
quarter for quarterly.
